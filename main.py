        1.  Content Impact: Does it grab attention, or is it a snooze-fest?
        2.  Skills Showcase: Are the skills highlighted effectively, or are they buried?
        3.  Experience Descriptions: Do they scream accomplishment, or whisper daily tasks?
        4.  Targeted Torching (for {job_role if job_role else 'general job applications'}): What specific flaws will hold it back for this role?

        Resume content:
        {file_content}
